- 👋 Hi, I’m @SrdjanTr
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, SEO, Operational Research, and BI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which include Data analysis, Machine learning, Data mining, Decision tree and similar concepts.
- 📫 How to reach me? Through this account or email SrdjanTr@yahoo.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: Male
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to have a lot of nicknames, like Martian, Rockit or Strike. First two due to the colorful hairstyle, but the last because of the last name and many strikes at that time.
